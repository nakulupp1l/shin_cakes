        <p>We use only the best ingredients to craft the perfect loaf. The perfect way to start your day. 
           The quality of bread is in the details. It's sweet, it's fluffy, it's delicious.
           A bite of deliciousness.
           A little bliss in every bite.
           A slice of my life is but a piece of cake.
           All you need is love. ...
           Bakers make the world smell better.
           Birthday cake calories don't count.
           Cake is a very beautiful thing.
           Cake is always a great idea.
        what's wrong with having your cake and eating it too?</p>
        <br>
  <p>I want the best of both worlds.
I thought that's what everyone was trying to do.
give me love
give me lust
give me ***
give me hugs
what's wrong with having your cake and eating it too?

I want my lover in my best friend
and my best friend in my lover.
I have my lover
but my best friend is in another
so I'm not committed
relationships ain't for me
I'm really just trying to have my cake and eat it too.

so now I have to hurt someone again
pull the famous line, "we're better off friends", "it's not you, it's me."
but if you put cake in front of me, I'm going to try to eat it too.

isn't that what everyone would do?</p>
